## Instructions:

Create the same Form that allows people to register for the website.
This time use the [React Hook Form library](https://react-hook-form.com/)

- The form should include a User name.
  `This should not be empty`
- Email address
  `Should be a valid emal, not empty`
- Phone number
  `Should be a valid phone number, and not empty`
- A password field
  `Should be 8 letters min, including number, sumbole, capital letter and small letter. It should also not be empty!`
- Confirm password
  `Should be the same as previous password`

When a field loses focus the validation should kick in and display the errors under its respective field. Make the message as helpful as possible.

There should be a reset button, to empty the form of any data.
